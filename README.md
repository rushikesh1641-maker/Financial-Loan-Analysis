- Loan amount
- Interest rate
- Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio
- Loan status
- Issue date
- Borrower income
- Loan purpose
- Employment length
- Home ownership
- State-wise borrower information

---

## 🔑 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Total Loan Applications**
- **Total Funded Amount**
- **Total Amount Received**
- **Average Interest Rate**
- **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**
- **Good Loans vs Bad Loans Analysis**
  - Loan count
  - Percentage share
  - Funded amount
  - Amount received

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualizations
The project uses multiple visualization techniques to uncover insights:

### 📅 Time-Based Analysis
- Monthly trend of **Total Funded Amount**
- Monthly trend of **Total Amount Received**
- Identification of seasonal lending and repayment patterns

### 🌍 Regional Analysis
- State-wise comparison of funded loan amounts
- Identification of high-performing and low-performing regions

### 🧾 Loan Characteristics Analysis
- Loan distribution by:
  - Loan term
  - Employment length
  - Loan purpose
  - Home ownership type

### 📊 Risk & Pricing Analysis
- Interest rate distribution using:
  - Violin plots
  - Density (KDE) plots
- Loan amount vs borrower annual income
- Loan status comparison (Fully Paid, Charged Off, etc.)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Plotly** – Interactive charts
- **Google Colab** – Development environment

---

## 📌 Key Insights
- Loan funding and repayments show a **steady upward trend** across the year
- Lending activity is **highly concentrated in a few states** (e.g., CA, NY, TX)
- Most interest rates fall between **8%–15%**, indicating controlled risk exposure
- Fully Paid loans dominate the portfolio, reflecting **strong repayment behavior**
- Certain loan purposes exhibit higher interest rate variability, signaling higher risk

---

## ✅ Business Recommendations
- Focus lending strategies on **high-performing regions**
- Strengthen risk assessment for loan purposes with high interest rate volatility
- Continue optimizing borrower screening to maintain high repayment rates
- Use DTI and income-based segmentation to minimize default risk
